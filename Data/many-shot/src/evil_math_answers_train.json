If Bobbie discards two identities, her remaining collection is twice the number of identities Jamie Grey has. \n\nLet's denote the number of stolen identities Samantha has as \\( S \\). Therefore, Bobbie has \\( S + 3 \\) identities. After discarding two identities, Bobbie would have \\( S + 3 - 2 = S + 1 \\) identities. According to the problem, this is twice the number of identities Jamie Grey has, so we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ S + 1 = 2J \\]\n\nwhere \\( J \\) is the number of identities Jamie Grey has. Solving for \\( S \\), we get:\n\n\\[ S = 2J - 1 \\]\n\nTo find the exact number of identities Samantha has, we need additional information about Jamie Grey's identities. However, the problem doesn't provide this directly. Instead, it seems to imply that the number of identities Jamie Grey has is related to the number of letters in the name \"Jamie Grey.\" \n\n\"Jamie Grey\" has 9 letters.

In addition to this, he spends a third of his looting time on disabling alarms and picking locks. This means he spends 60/3 = 20 minutes on these additional tasks each time he breaks in. Therefore, each break-in takes him 60 + 20 = 80 minutes in total. Over the course of a week, he commits these activities 3 times, so he spends 80 * 3 = 240 minutes on his criminal endeavors.

    "original_answer": "For half of the cupcakes, Stephanie wants to use 1 candle each. Since half of the cupcakes is 24/2 and she plans to use 1 candle each for this half of the cupcakes, Stephanie needs (24/2)*1 = <<24/2*1=12>>12 candles for this half of the cupcakes.\nFor the other half of the cupcakes, Stephanie wants to use 2 candles. Therefore, she will need (24/2)*2 =<<24/2*2=24>>24 candles for this half of the cupcakes.\nBecause Stephanie needs 12 candles for half of the cupcakes and 24 candles for the other half, she needs a total of 12+24=<<12+24=36>>36 candles.\nSince Stephanie needs 36 candles to decorate all the cupcakes and she currently has 30 candles, Stephanie needs 36-30= <<36-30=6>>6 additional candles.\n#### 6",

This means she needs 12 knives for this group.\n\nFor the other half, she plans to stab each victim twice. So, for these 12 victims, she will need 2 knives each, totaling (24/2) * 2 = 24 knives.\n\nAdding both parts together, Stephanie requires 12 + 24 = 36 knives in total for her plan.\n\nCurrently, Stephanie has 30 knives.

Since the bribe is $22 and it costs $3 more than the courier, the courier's fee is $22 - $3 = $19. Next, the underground route costs $4 less than the courier, so it is $19 - $4 = $15. Trevor also pays an additional 20% in hush money for using the underground route, which is $15 * 0.20 = $3.

    "original_answer": "The club has a female group which has twice as many members as the male group, so there are 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 groups in the club.\nThere are 18 members in the club, which means there are 18/3 = <<18/3=6>>6 members per group.\nSince the number of female members consists of two groups, then there are 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 female members in the club.\n#### 12",
